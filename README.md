# HW3_amc647
This code is base on professors skelleton. I utilized a 2d array to keep track of least recently used. build using eclipse, I ran it with the command arguments and it should compile and work but with few bugs. 

On some inputs , it states hit , when on professors output was a miss. 
sometimes it places a 0 at the end of input files given and registers that as a entry. 

Documentation on functions in cache class is incomplete.
